# Presentation of Roles



#### 0) Root user

Only for administrator of the platform.

Root user can manage and send certifications to the Blockchain.

The can access database diagram and run pre-defined migrations and scripts.


#### 1) Eco Manager

The ecosystem is the highest degree.

The eco-manager corresponds to the buyer of BrainElem and, therefore, to the owner.

Its role is a decision-making role (even political), since it is a question of opening subscriptions (networks) and defining the modules that will compose them (School centre, Training centre, cognitive centre).

It also creates a manager for each subscription (network manager)

He also decides to open the library of the ecosystem (cloud) in order to allow or not to allow content created by users to be shared throughout the ecosystem.

This is the “owner” who decides to open subscriptions and grant access.



#### 2) Network Manager

The subscription (network) is a grouping of modules (school center, training center, cognitive center).

The role of the network manager is to define the number of users he needs.

It also defines who is responsible for each module.

He is the head of the network to which the owner has given access for his establishment or business. It is limited to creating an administrative manager (Module Manger) who will manage the platform.


#### 3) Cloud Manager (currently turned off in the system)

The Cloud is the library of the ecosystem.

The cloud-manager is the library manager of the ecosystem.

Its role is to accept or refuse content.

When content is accepted, it will automatically be available to all users in the ecosystem. Teachers of all modules belonging to the ecosystem will therefore be able to access it and use it in their course space.



#### 4) Module Manager

The module is the "functional" entity of BrainElem, to which a user is directly attached.

The three types are “School Center”, “Training Center”, “Cognitive Center”.

It is from this level that the roles mutate slightly, as described later in this document.

The role of the module leader is an “administrative” role. He creates the “pieces of the puzzle” (learners, trainers, themes, modules).

It assigns roles within the platform.

He is therefore the administrator of the platform.



## SCHOOL CENTER

#### SC4) Module Manager

The manager module of the School module is the administrative manager of the platform.

He defines the straightjacket of his school; indeed, the school is “rigid”, since it follows state programs:

    • School year
    • Rating scale
    • Subjects (subjects) and chapters taught in the program
    • Number of classes

It creates (or imports) users and assigns them their role (student, teacher, etc.).


#### SC5) Librarian

The librarian is the manager of the module library.

Its role is to accept or refuse content.

When the content is accepted, it will automatically be available to all users of the module. Other teachers will therefore be able to access it and use it in their course space.


#### SC6) Architect

The role of the architect within a module is to fit together the pieces of the puzzle created by the module manager to create training paths, classes, etc.

It must be occupied by the school pedagogue.

Indeed, he

    • Creates training paths by selecting the subjects and chapters that appear in the program; he must therefore know the teaching programs

    • Builds its classes, by associating the right training path. It assigns teachers to the subject they teach. He enrolls students in their class.


In addition, he has access to the various teaching programs, can see the content assigned by the teachers and can add content.

Finally, he also has the possibility of determining the skills to be validated, and defining the educational reports to be completed by the class leader.

He is the pedagogical engineer.



#### SC7) Trainer (teacher)

The teacher has access to the classes to which he is assigned.

It finds the classic functions of an LMS:

    • Agenda: announces homework and exams. It can link the task at hand to content created in E-Learning. He can also consult the homework given by the other teachers in the class.

    • Gradebook: he enters the grades, assigns the coefficients and sees the averages directly. He can also consult the marks of the students of the class in the other subjects.

    • Course space: he accesses the library (private, that of the school or that of the ecosystem) and can deposit the content created in his teaching path.

    • Exams and homework: he accesses the results of the homework and exams carried out by his E-Learning students


He also accesses his content creation space. Inside it, he can deposit or create

    • Written content (pdf, word, ppt,…)
    • Audio-visual content (sound, videos, images)
    • Quiz

The labeling of its content, assisted by AI, makes it possible to classify the content at the subject/chapter/sub-chapter level and to associate a level with it.


#### SC8) Class manager

The class leader is the pedagogical manager of the class assigned to him.

In addition to the duties of a teacher, he can

    • View and edit student grades in all subjects

    • See and modify the lesson spaces of all the subjects taught in your class

    • Create and edit educational reports (skills validation)


#### SC9) Inspector

The role of the inspector is that of an observer. He can see (but modify/edit/delete/add nothing).

    • The grades and averages of all students
    • Diaries of all students
    • Reports from all students
    • The course spaces of all classes, including their content
#### SC10) Trainee (student)

The student has access to the class in which he is registered:

    • Diary: he sees his homework and exams

    • Gradebook: he sees his detailed grades, but also his averages

    • Report: he sees his skills noted and commented on by his class leader

    • Course space: he accesses the content deposited by the teachers and can carry out his E-Learning exercises there


The student has access to his cognitive space where he can see his BrainCore values, his advice, his possible problems (which he can validate or not) and his solutions (activities, contents, ...).

Finally, he can explore the content made available and can follow a course that is not in his course space.


#### SC11) Parent

He has the same rights (except to do the exercises) as his child(ren).


## TRAINING CENTER

#### TC4) Module Manager

In the Training Center, the module-manager fulfills the missions of the administrative and the pedagogue.

As such, it is the fusion of the “module-manager” and the “architect”.

    • It creates or imports users and assigns them a role
    • He can create an assistant and then he determines the actions he can take (among his own)

    • It creates categories, subjects, chapters

    • He creates the courses (by associating chapters)

    • It defines an “internship in a company”

    • It defines the blocks of skills to be assessed and the certificates to be issued

    • He creates the training course (by associating one or more courses, an internship in a company, a certificate)

    • He creates a session (a training path managed by a training manager, with the course and registration dates and a price)

    • At the end of a session, it sends the certificates obtained and issued and sends them to the blockchain so that they become tokens.


#### TC5) Librarian

The librarian is the manager of the module library.

Its role is to accept or refuse content.

When the content is accepted, it will automatically be available to all users of the module. Other teachers will therefore be able to access it and use it in their course space.


#### TC6) Assistant

The module-manager in the Training Center has the possibility of “creating” an assistant.

It is a role whose functions he defines himself, based on his own.

In other words, he can choose to delegate some (or all) of the functions that he can perform himself.



#### TC 7) Training Manager

The training manager is responsible for a training session. He accesses the session that has been configured by the module manager and undertakes the following actions:

    • It accepts students who have registered for a session and assigns them to a group.

    • He assigns the trainers to the chapters of the course

    • He assigns a coordinator to the work placement

    • He accesses the program monitoring tools (agenda, course space and content, grade table)

    • At the end of a session, he accesses the validation of skills by the trainers and issues the certificate.


#### TC 8) Trainer (teacher)

The trainer is the teacher of the chapter(s) assigned to him/her in a training session.
    • Agenda: announces homework and exams. It can link the task at hand to content created in E-Learning. He can also consult the homework given by the other teachers in the class.

    • Gradebook: he enters the grades, assigns the coefficients and sees the averages directly. He can also consult the marks of the students of the class in the other subjects.

    • Course space: he accesses the library (private, that of the school or that of the ecosystem) and can deposit the content created in his teaching path.

    • Exams and homework: he accesses the results of the homework and exams carried out by his E-Learning students

At the end of the session, he validates the skills according to the certification method that has been defined.


#### TC 10) Trainee (student)

The learner has access to the session in which he is registered:

    • Diary: he sees his homework and exams

    • Gradebook: he sees his detailed grades, but also his averages

    • Report: he sees his skills noted and commented on by his class leader

    • Course space: he accesses the content deposited by the teachers and can carry out his E-Learning exercises there

    • Certificate: he receives his certificate at the end of the session


The student has access to his cognitive space where he can see his BrainCore values, his advice, his possible problems (which he can validate or not) and his solutions (activities, contents, ...).

Finally, he can explore the content made available and can follow a course that is not in his course space.

Big difference compared to the “School Center” module: the learner can create a BrainElem account by himself and register for a session of his choice.

He can go buy a session (credit card or paypal).


#### TC11) Partner (Business Partner)

A company can create an account on its own.

She then has the possibility of accessing the different sessions that exist in the platform and sending a request (inquiry) for the registration of a group of employees directly to the module-manager.

She also has the possibility of contacting the module-manager to ask him to open a training session.

As soon as the session is open, the business partner accesses the follow-up of the training of its employees (vision of the notebook, the agenda, the course space, skills and certificates).
